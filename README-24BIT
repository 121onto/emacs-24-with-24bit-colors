This diff is a modified version of a diff written by RÃ¼diger Sonderfeld.

To enable the feature one must set one of 2 environment variables either
ITERM_24BIT or KONSOLE_DBUS_SESSION. The former will enable ITU T.416 mode, the
latter will use semi-colon seperators used by other terminals (and also
supported by iterm development branch). If you also use tmux with the 24bit
patch you may need to use the latter environment variable.

I've added ITERM_24BIT as an environment variable to set that will cause emacs
to use the : seperated values as specified by ITU T.416. These are apparently
better to use and supported by iterm development branch.

Other chagnes:
- modified map_tty_color to set the color into the pixel field.
- modified the colors defined to be the standard X11 list.
- modified tty-color-desc to add missing colors on demand.
